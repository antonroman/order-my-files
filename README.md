order-my-files
==============

Very simple application written in Go to order all the files in a folder. It creates *YYYY_MM* subfolders based on modification dates of the existing files. The application creates the folders and moves the files to them. I originally wrote this to order my photos and as an exercise to start programming in Go.

How to execute: 
`go run order-my-files.go <absolute path>`
